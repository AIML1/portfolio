SQL-Query-COVID vaccination
The first project on my data analytics portfolio project is COVID vaccination. This is basically data exploration project using SQL dataset. Here I have downloaded the dataset from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 
Later this dataset is modified as two different files named  COVID DEATHS and COVID Vaccinations. I have reduced tons of data since I use limited fields.
Firstly I pulled up total cases vs total deaths for the country INDIA.
NEXT took look at total cases vs population i.e population affected by COVID
Thirdly we looked at countries with highest infection rate compared to population 
Finally we looked for many more things like highest deaths and so on.
